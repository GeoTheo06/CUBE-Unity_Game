# CUBE
CUBE is a 3D game developed in Unity where the player controls a ball and rolls down an aisle while trying to dodge a randomly spawned set of red obstacles and remain on the aisle. The game was created as a project to learn the basics of Unity game development and has a simplistic yet challenging gameplay.

## Technologies Used
CUBE was developed in Unity game engine using C# scripting language. The game features 3D graphics and sound effects. The UI for the end screen and menu with scores was also created in Unity.

## Gameplay
The gameplay of CUBE involves controlling a ball down an aisle using the WASD keys and spacebar to jump for PC and using the arrow symbols to move the ball and tapping anywhere on the screen to jump for the android Version. The player must dodge a set of red obstacles that are randomly spawned on the aisle and try to remain on the aisle without falling off. As the game progresses, the speed of the ball increases, making it more challenging for the player to avoid obstacles and stay on the aisle.
